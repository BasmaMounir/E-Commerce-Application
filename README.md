# State Management and Architecture
> This project utilizes the BLoC (Business Logic Component) pattern for state management, coupled with Clean Architecture principles.

## BLoC Pattern
+ Business Logic Component (BLoC): Manages the application's state and business logic.
+ Separation of Concerns: Business logic is separated from the UI layer, promoting better code organization and testability.
## Clean Architecture
+ Separation of Concerns: Layers are organized into distinct modules with clear responsibilities.
+ Dependency Injection: Utilizes dependency injection to decouple components and improve testability.
+ Entities, Use Cases, and Data Sources: Layers are divided into entities (domain), use cases (application), and data sources (infrastructure).

## API Integration
- This app integrates with a backend API to fetch product data, manage user authentication, and handle other relevant operations.
